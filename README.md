## How its work ?<br>   
TabbyPOS adopts a peer-to-peer payment method, where cryptocurrency is transferred directly from the user's wallet to the merchant's wallet. We do not handle or custody any assets, so there are no compliance issues related to asset custody or transfers. Our device integrates multi-chain functionality and is equipped with a backend system for viewing payment records, making payments more convenient and management more efficient for merchants and customers.

## Token Info
### $TABBY<br>
EPOS is a token we issued in 2023 for fundraising. At that time, we raised tens of thousands, but as we were still new to the crypto space, we lacked experience in managing it. After going through the bear market, the funds we raised have significantly depreciated. However, we never gave up—despite the lack of funding, we continue to build with passion and dedication.<br><br>
$EPOS holders will share the revenue generated by TabbyPOS through airdrops.
Remarks: Currently, we do not encourage trading as we are waiting for the ERGO Rosen team to enable cross-chain functionality to BSC. Once available, the majority of our liquidity will be migrated to the BSC

### $TABBY 🔥🔥<br>
TABBY was initially a test token I created while integrating with Solana. One day, it unexpectedly gained traction on PumpFun and successfully launched. Given Solana's recent surge in popularity, we have officially announced that we will manage and maintain this token as either a meme for TabbyPOS or a symbolic representation of the project.<br><br>
$TABBY holders will share revenue generated by TabbyPOS on the Solana chain through airdrops. $TABBY is currently experiencing a surge in popularity, so we are dedicating more time and effort to managing and growing the token.<br><br>
